    <h1>Leah's Week 5 Assignment - Part 3: </h1>
    <h2> Let's have a little fun with some Reggae-ton-ton-ton </h2>
    <p> Checking the magical console to see some outputs.</p>
    <!-- Create an unordered list with any questions you have -->
    <ul> <li> When I look at the showCollection function, I feel like it is only applicable to the collection array
              How could I create a function that would loop through any array and list each object? </ul> </li>
